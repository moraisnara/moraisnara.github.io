I am a PhD student in Economic Theory at IPE/USP. I hold a Master's degree in Economics from the Center for Development and Regional Planning (CEDEPLAR) at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) and an undergraduate degree from Economic Sciences from the Federal University of Uberl√¢ndia (UFU). My research interests lie in development economics, public policy evaluation, and gender economics. I have experience cleaning databases, estimating econometric models with R (and Stata), and creating documents in Latex.
