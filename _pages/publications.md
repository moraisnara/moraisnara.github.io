## Working Papers

**The Role of Local Politicians on Environmental Degradation: Evidence
from Brazil** (with Bruno Miranda) 

Presented at: _ENABER 2024, ANPEC 2024, Microeconomic LAERE 2025_

This paper investigates the role of local political leadership in shaping environmental outcomes in Brazil. Specifically, we examine whether the election of left-wing mayors—who are typically more aligned with pro-environmental agendas—leads to lower levels of environmental degradation. Combining electoral with environmental data, we find that electing a left-wing mayor reduces deforestation by 34 km², nearly 8\% of the control mean. These effects are robust across specifications and bandwidths. The impact is amplified in municipalities ideologically aligned with state and federal governments. We provide suggestive evidence that reduced ties to agribusiness and voter preferences may explain these results. Our findings contribute to the literature on political determinants of environmental policy and underscore the importance of local governments in advancing environmental protection in decentralized governance contexts.

**The Limits of Legal Protection: Evaluating the Impact of Homotransphobia Criminalization on LGBT Violence in Brazil**

Presented at: _GEFAM 2025_

Despite important legal advances in LGBT rights in Brazil, LGBT individuals continue to face disproportionately high levels of violence. This paper investigates whether the 2019 Supreme Court decision that criminalized homotransphobia led to a change in the patterns of violence against LGBT individuals in municipalities with LGBT support infrastructure. Using data on violence notifications from health units between 2016 and 2022, combined with information on municipal-level LGBT support infrastructure, I implement an event study to assess the policy’s impact. The results show no evidence of a differential change in violence notifications in municipalities with LGBT support services after the ruling. Despite the overall null effects, the results point to a small differential impact when disaggregating by gender, indicating that the policy may have affected subgroups within the LGBT population in distinct ways. Altogether, these findings suggest either limited enforcement capacity at the local level or a broader ineffectiveness of the criminalization in improving safety.
